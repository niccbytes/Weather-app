## Description

everyday we venture out into the world as prepeared as we might be it always falls short, but with this application you will no longer fall short of anything becasue when you know the weather you know what to where, what to do, where to go and so much more!

## Bugs
There is two small bugs i have not been able to figure out, number one is the file path of my images for the days to come and number 2 is at times the application will look all janky and all over the place but when i refresh or just enter the city name it starts to function properly.

## Features 
With this application you can:
- enter a city name in the search box.
- view the current day and the following days to come weather.
- you can see all the past enteries.
